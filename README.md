# GitHub Copilot Hands-On: Ft. Agent Mode 

Welcome to the **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode** hands-on workshop, where we code less, vibe more!  
You bring the ideas, and Copilot brings them to life.

### 🤖 What We'll Build

We’ll design a **dynamic dashboard** to visualize Infineon’s product and sales data (already available in the `data/` folder as a CSV file).

Here’s your mission:
- Explore the data to understand what’s possible.
- Choose your favorite frameworks (Streamlit, Dash, etc.) for building the dashboard. It's your call.
- Share your dashboard vision: describe your idea in words, share a mockup, or even a hand-drawn doodle!
- Let Copilot Agent Mode handle the implementation

### 📄 Project Requirements Document (PRD)

You *could* just ask Copilot:  
> "Hey, here’s my data. Can you make some cool visualizations?"

But you often want more control like choosing the framework, setting the layout, or picking a certain style, so it’s best to give Copilot a clear description of what you want.  
That’s where the **Project Requirements Document** (PRD) comes in!

Check out `PRD.md` in this repo. It’s your starting point with info on:
- Framework choices
- Directory structure
- Dashboard component descriptions

By providing a PRD, you empower Copilot (especially in Agent Mode) to build end-to-end applications that match your vision. The more details you give, the better Copilot can deliver exactly what you want.

## 🛠️ Hands-On: Part 1 - Build Your Dashboard with Copilot Agent Mode

- The PRD is pre-populated, but there are **TODOs for you to fill in**.
- We’ve provided sample descriptions, but eventually **YOU** decide how your dashboard should look!
- Don’t stop at the PRD. You can also give Copilot some **visual input** to inspire it. This could be:
  - 🎨 A color palette that matches your brand (the Infineon brand palette can be found in the pictures folder)
  - 🖼️ Screenshots of dashboards you love
  - ✏️ A (hand-drawn) doodle that captures your idea?

### Let’s Build Step by Step

1. **Personalize Your PRD:**  
   Open `PRD.md` and fill in the details. Make it as detailed as you want.

2. **Activate Agent Mode:**  
   In Copilot, switch to Agent Mode. Give it your finished PRD and simply ask:  
   > "Please implement this" (we stay polite, right? 😉)

   Most of the instructions are already in your PRD, so you don’t need a fancy prompt.

3. **Watch Agent Mode in Action:**  
   Copilot will build your dashboard. Review what it creates, play around, and don’t be shy to ask for tweaks or changes until it’s just right!

4. **Show Off Your Work:**  
   Once you’re happy, launch your dashboard and share it with the group!

## 🤖 Copilot Modes Explained

| Mode        | Who’s in Control? | What Can Copilot Do? |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Ask**     | You               | Copilot suggests, you decide what to apply. No code changes unless you act. |
| **Edit**    | You (with help)   | Copilot edits your code inline, shows a diff, but you approve every change. Only affects files you specify. |
| **Agent**   | Copilot (with your approval) | Copilot can create, edit, delete files across the workspace, run terminal commands, and more. You approve actions step-by-step or at the end. |

> **Agent Mode** is like having a supercharged AI teammate. You just need to guide it a bit!
